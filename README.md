🕺💃 Dance Challenge
A two-player rhythm game built with Pygame Zero where players compete to match dance moves and earn the highest score.

Player 1: W (Up), A (Left), S (Down), D (Right)

Player 2: ↑ (Up), ← (Left), ↓ (Down), → (Right)

Match the sequence correctly to build your combo and increase your score. The player with the highest score at the end wins!
